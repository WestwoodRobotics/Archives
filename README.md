# BEST-2016
Code for the BEST 2016 season: [Bet the Farm](http://www.bestinc.org/b_game_rules.php)

## Drive
The robot has two possible drive modes.
* **Tank Drive**: Controlling each wheel independently of the other, with its respective joystick
* **Arcade Drive**: Controlling the wheels together, using one joystick for forward/back motion, and one stick for turning

## The Sweeper
The robot has a sweeper on the front, which collects items from the ground to spit out of its top. This is one continuous motion, so for most of its use, it only needs to rotate in one direction.

## The Net
The robot has a net that catches corn that falls off of te stalks. It can then move up and down to shake the corn out.

## The Water Servo
On the side of the robot, there is a servo which is controlled by the buttons on the controller, becoming capable of almost continuous movement. This is for turning the water valve to the correct point during the competition.
